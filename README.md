# Boggle-Word-Checker-CWs

Given a word and a 2D grid of letters, the function has to check if the word can be formed from the grid.
Valid guesses are strings which can be formed by connecting adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
without re-using any previously used cells.

The problem can be solved via recursion, but for added challenge I solved it using iteration.
